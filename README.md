# Gitlet

This project implements a simplified version control system that replicates several core features of Git.

A version control system is essentially a backup and tracking system for collections of related files. Gitlet supports the following key functionalities:

- Committing: Saves the contents of entire directories. Each snapshot is referred to as a commit.
- Checking Out: Restores a version of one or more files, or an entire commit.
- Logging: Displays the history of commits to help track changes over time.
- Branching: Maintains multiple lines of development through branches.
- Merging: Combines changes from one branch into another.
